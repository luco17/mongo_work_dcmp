How does this correspond to Mongo?

Database maps names to collections, you can access collections by name in the same way you can access values in a Python dictionary. 

A collection is like a list of dictionaries, called 'documents' in mongodb, similar to a table in a reqular SQL DB.

When a dictionary is a value within a document, that's a subdoc
